# Minesweeper

This project will teach you how to work with lists in Kotlin.
You will be dealing with algorithms for generating the minefield and processing the player moves.

## About

They say a minesweeper makes only two mistakes in their life: the first is their choice of occupation, and the second one is fatal.
In this project, you will create your own, safe "Minesweeper" – a game that will be a brain teaser for both you and your players.

## What you'll learn

Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course to get it built.
Here’s what awaits you:

### Description

Minesweeper is a game of logic where the player is presented with a field full of hidden mines.
The goal is to mark the positions of all mines without setting any of them off.
It's not a game of wild guessing: it offers hints showing the number of mines around each cell.
One wrong move, and game over!

### Objective

Your first step is easy: you need to output some state of the minefield.

Set the minefield size and place any number of mines you want on it.
At this point, all the mines are there in plain sight – we are not going to hide them from the player just yet.

You can use any character you want to represent mines and safe cells at this step.
Later on, we will use `X` for mines and `.` for safe cells.

### Example

In this example, there are 10 mines on a 9x9 field. Feel free to use your own marking symbols and field configuration!

```console
.X.......
.....X..X
....X....
......X..
..X......
....X....
..X......
..X......
......X..
```
